## Greetings traveller 🖖

So, this mess what you see is all my handiwork. Trying to keep improve everything up to date but there's quite a lot work to do 🤔 especially when i've had like ~~6 month~~ loong break on updating repositories but still been improving stuff 😬

Currently my daily bread comes from working with Microsoft technologies. I am mainly working with M365 security but so often I also need to figure out solutions build on top of Azure, M365 Collaboration tools, automations and anything & everything under the Microsoft cloud umbrella 💪  
Sometimes I even explore ancient servers to figure what the h*ck is going on 🙃🫠

In my previous role I was working with M365 collaboration tools building SharePoint Online & Teams solutions (codeless) and automations with Power Automate and Azure Logic Apps. I even maintained and developed solutions for SharePoint 2007⚰️, 2010⚰️, 2013⚰️ and 2016 farms. For over an year I was leading team of 7 members who were responsible of upkeep & maintenance of sharepoint farms and developing M365 collaboration solutions. 
And before someone gets an idea, No 🚫. I am not looking nor be available for opportunities regarding to On-premises SharePoint or M365 Collaboration tools. 😂

I'm still studying the security aspect of M365, ***Microsoft Sentinel***, Microsoft Defender XDR and Identity management.
