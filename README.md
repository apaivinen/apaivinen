## Greetings traveller

So this mess what you see is all my handiwork. Trying to keep improve everything up to date but there's quite a lot work to do 🤔 especially when i've had like ~~6 month~~ loong break on updating repositories but still been improving stuff 😬

My daily bread comes from working with Microsoft technologies. I'm mainly working with M365 security but so often I also need to figure out Azure, M365 Collaboration and anything under the Microsoft product umbrella. Sometimes I even explore the ancient servers to figure what's going on 🙃

I'm currently studying the security aspect of M365, ***Microsoft Sentinel***, Microsoft Defender and Identity management.
some sertificate goals for year ~~2022~~ ~~2023~~ 2024: 
* SC-200: Microsoft Security Operations Analyst 📌 <!-- ✅ -->
* MS-500: Microsoft 365 Security Administration
* AZ-500: AZ-500: Microsoft Azure Security Technologies
* SC-300: Microsoft Identity and Access Administrator
* SC-400: Microsoft Information Protection Administrator

On my free time I like to tinker with home automation and other tech stuff🤖, play video games🎮 and enjoy the nature🍃.
