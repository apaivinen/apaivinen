### Greetings traveller

So this mess what you see is all my handiwork. Trying to keep improve everything up to date but there's quite a lot work to do 🤔 especially when i've had like 6 month break on updating repositories but still been improving stuff 😬

My daily bread comes from working with Microsoft technologies. Mainly working with M365 collaboration tools but there's general M365 & Azure management & "Development" here and there. Sometimes I even explore the ancient servers to figure what's going on 🙃

I'm currently studying the security aspect of M365, ***Microsoft Sentinel***, Microsoft Defender and Identity management.
some sertificate goals for year 2022:
* 📌SC-200: Microsoft Security Operations Analyst <!-- ✅ -->
* SC-300: Microsoft Identity and Access Administrator
* SC-400: Microsoft Information Protection Administrator
* MS-500: Microsoft 365 Security Administration

some tech keywords what describes my monthly routine: Logic App/Power automate, Powershell, Azure AD, SharePoint(online & on-premises), Teams

On my free time I like to tinker with home automation🤖, play video games🎮 and enjoy the nature🍃. 

Motto is "If it can be automated then you should automate it."
